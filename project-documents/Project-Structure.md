# Project Structure

This file provides a brief overview of the projects structure and design.

## Component Hierarchy

The key components of the project need to be identified and structured correctly, these are not pages but components that can be coded and reused throughout the project, for example:

- App component: serves as the main entry point and houses the routing logic.

- Home component: displays a landing page with an overview and options for users.

- Maps component: allows users to select the map they played on.

- Game Modes component: enables users to choose the game mode they played.

- Buttons components: buttons used throughout the whole application.

## Routing

Routing will be used to define routes for different pages, such as home, record statistics and other

- Set up routing using a package like `react-router-dom`

## Data Management

Decide on the data structure required for tracking the COD statistics.

- Could use React's state management, or consider using external libraries such as Redux or Zustand to handle data throughout the website.

## Design and Styling

Research and select a CSS library such as Bootsrap, Material-UI or Tailwind CSS to simplify and enhance the website design.

- Import the neccessary components and styles from chosen CSS library.

- Customize and style the components to fit your website's theme and requirements.

## API Integration

Research, identify and integrate an API for the project.

- Configure API calls to retrieve, update and delete users statistics.

- Import the neccessary components and styles from chosen CSS library.

- Customize and style the components to fit your website's theme and requirements.

## User Interface

Design intuitive and user-friendly interfaces for each page and component.

- Utilize UI/UX best practices to ensure a smooth user experience.

- Implement forms and input fields to allow users to input their game statistics.

## Validation and Error Handling

Implement form validation to ensure data integrity and proper user inputs.

- Handle API errors and display meaningful error messages to users.

## Testing

Write unit tests for critical functionalities and components.

- Use testing libraries such as Jest and React Testing Library to perform automated testing.

## Deployment

Choose a suitable hosting platform.

- Configure the deployment process to automatically build and deploy your React application.
