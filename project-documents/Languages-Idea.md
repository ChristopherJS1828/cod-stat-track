# Idea Of What Languages To Use Where & Why

This file elaborates where and how the use of both JavaScript and TypeScript would benefit the application.

## TypeScript

### Data Models and Interfaces

- TypeScript's static typing can be beneficial when defining data models and interfaces for representing the statistics. By using TypeScript, we can ensure type safety, catch potential errors at compile-time, and provide better tooling support for developers working with the data models.

### API Integration

- TypeScript can be valuable when working with APIs to fetch the data. TypeScript can provide type definitions for API responses and help in handling and transforming the data in a type-safe manner. It also aids in making API calls more explicit and maintaining better consistency.

### Business Logic

- TypeScript is well-suited for implementing the business logic of our website. By utilizing TypeScript's static typing, we can catch common programming mistakes early, improve maintainability, and enhance code documentation. TypeScript also supports modern JavaScript features, so we can enjoy the benefits of both languages.

## JavaScript

### UI Components

- JavaScript is commonly used for creating interactive UI components. React, being primarily written in JavaScript, naturally integrates well with JavaScript. Utilize JavaScript for implementing React components, rendering UI elements, and managing component state.

### Third-Party Libraries

- Many UI component libraries and utility libraries are typically developed in JavaScript. When integrating these libraries into your project, you will use JavaScript to incorporate their functionalities seamlessly.

### External Scripts

- If there are any external scripts or dependencies that are only available in JavaScript, you will need to use JavaScript to incorporate them into your project. This could include plugins, analytics scripts, or any other JavaScript-based integrations.
